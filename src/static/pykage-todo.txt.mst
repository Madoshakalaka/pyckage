To Do

1. Push the generated project to github

2. Go on travis CI and add the newly created repo

3. Cd to the newly created project

4. python setup.py sdist

5. python -m twine upload dist/*

6. travis encrypt your-password-here --add deploy.password to encryt your password as a secure password. It will append it to the end of the file. Open .travis.yml and move the added secure password to the commented out line

7. Enjoy - start to write your packages and fill the tests

If you do everything following the instruction. If you just change the version string in setup.py everytime you want to publish a new package version, every tagged push to github will automatically trigger a pypi release.
